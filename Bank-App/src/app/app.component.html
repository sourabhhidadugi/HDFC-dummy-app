            Digital banking is the new best thing that could have happened to

            Online banking is exactly as it sounds — banking online. When you
            access your bank account online and conduct financial transactions,
            you are participating in online banking as a consumer. Whether
            that’s with a brick-and-mortar bank’s online portal or with an
            online-only bank’s website, the process is pretty much the same. The
            2 main forms of online banking include: <br />
            Online-only banks or challenger banks that offer conventional
            banking products and financial services, but in an online-only
            format. Traditional banks that offer online banking services via an
            app or online portal.

          Morgan Stanley is an American multinational investment bank and
          financial services company headquartered at 1585 Broadway in Midtown
          Manhattan, New York City. With offices in more than 42 countries and
          more than 60,000 employees, the firm's clients include corporations,
          governments, institutions, and individuals. Morgan Stanley ranked No.
          67 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States
          corporations by total revenue. The original Morgan Stanley, formed by
          J.P. Morgan & Co. partners Henry Sturgis Morgan (grandson of J.P.
          Morgan), Harold Stanley, and others, came into existence on September
          16, 1935, in response to the Glass–Steagall Act that required the
          splitting of commercial and investment banking businesses. In its
          first year, the company operated with a 24% market share (US$1.1
          billion) in public offerings and private placements.

          At Harding Loevner, we collaborate to foster opposing viewpoints, not
          to achieve consensus. Individuals, not committees, make decisions and
          are solely accountable for the results. Undistracted by high-frequency
          information that is often noise, we focus on a few fundamental signals
          that show companies’ progress in creating value. Equity-based
          compensation aligns our goals and time horizon with those of our
          clients. Success can only be replicated through a repeatable process.
          Our structured investment process mitigates the unconscious biases
          that plague human decision-making. Requiring views to be written and
          broadly shared lets each of us see what others are thinking and puts
          them on the record. This transparency facilitates objective appraisal
          of contributions and continuous self-improvement, at the level of both
          the individual and the organization.
